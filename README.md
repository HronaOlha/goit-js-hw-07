## Tasks

#### Image gallery

Create a gallery with the ability to click on its elements and view the full-size image in a modal window.

##### Gallery element markup
The link to the original image must be stored in the data-attribute source on the <img> element, and specified in the href of the link. Do not add any HTML tags or CSS classes other than those contained in template.
